This directory contains scripts that:
<p>enable migrating to the new podcaster
<p>automatically connect Shows with Channels by setting podcast_channel_id field in the show table
<p>test the new podcaster's API (audio file creation, xml file creation)



<h1>time to migrate the podcasts!</h1>
<h2> then execute the following scripts by clicking on them (in order!)</h2>
<h2> 1) <a href='../../db_migrations.php' target="_blank">ensure all database migrations are run successfully</a>
<h2> 2)  <a href='ingest_xml.php' target="_blank">Ingest podcast xml data</a> (takes a couple minutes)</h2>
<h2> 3) Run <a href='connect-shows-with-channels.php' target="_blank">Connect Shows with Channels</a>. To auto-connect many shows to their channels Observe the output, because not all will work, and the rest have to be done manually
<h2>  4) import <a href="../misc/oldplaylists.php" target="_blank"> old playlists </a>. (probably already done)
  <h2> 5) run <a href="connect-playlists-with-episodes.php" target="_blank">connect playlists with episodes.</a>
