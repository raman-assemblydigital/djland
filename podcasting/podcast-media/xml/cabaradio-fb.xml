So that got CabaRadio to thinking...why not give you the chance to do just that!?
That's when we came up with the idea of 'You pick the Playlist' a show where you, one of our listeners gets to come on the show and pick the music for the night. Not only that but you get to talk about why you wanted it played, or what it means to you, or hell maybe you just really dig the song!
Maybe you want to play an 80's set, or a punk set, maybe you are like us and you wanna play a whole bunch of different music all on the same show or maybe just maybe you are a musician and you wanna showcase all your own stuff, you can do that to...it's your Playlist!
Their are a few rules of course, like you have to play some Canadian Content aka CANCON and you have to play some female content aka FEMCON but other than that, the mic and music is all yours.

Join us tonight http://citr.ca/ at 11pm as sexy librarian DJ Lexis picks the playlist! DJ Alexis brings the spirit of the of the Big Easy as Teddy &amp; Eroc sit back, crack a cold one and listen in as one of our listeners picks the music for the night
Tune in to hear DJ Lexis as she becomes CabaRadio's DJ!!

The adventure awaits tonight at 11pm on CITR 101.9fm or online at http://citr.ca/

PS if you would like to Pick the Playlist some night on CabaRadio please email us at cabaradio@gmail.com with the subject &quot;I wanna pick the playlist&quot; We do it every couple of months, so sign up now and start picking your list!

Hello 2012 the year of change!</title><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2012 23:09:43 -0800</pubDate><description>Over the years of doing a radio show, a lot of people have come up and said &quot;oh, it would be so cool to do a radio show&quot; or &quot;I wish I could do what you do&quot;. So that got CabaRadio to thinking...why not give you the chance to do just that!?
That's when we came up with the idea of 'You pick the Playlist' a show where you, one of our listeners gets to come on the show and pick the music for the night. Not only that but you get to talk about why you wanted it played, or what it means to you, or hell maybe you just really dig the song!
Maybe you want to play an 80's set, or a punk set, maybe you are like us and you wanna play a whole bunch of different music all on the same show or maybe just maybe you are a musician and you wanna showcase all your own stuff, you can do that to...it's your Playlist!
Their are a few rules of course, like you have to play some Canadian Content aka CANCON and you have to play some female content aka FEMCON but other than that, the mic and music is all yours.

Join us tonight http://citr.ca/ at 11pm as our original picker J-Biz comes back to the airwaves and gives us a look back at songs that were on his playlist in 2011!  
Tune in to hear J-Biz as she becomes CabaRadio's DJ for the night!!

The adventure awaits tonight at 11pm on CITR 101.9fm or online at http://citr.ca/

PS if you would like to Pick the Playlist some night on CabaRadio please email us at cabaradio@gmail.com with the subject &quot;I wanna pick the playlist&quot; We do it every couple of months, so sign up now and start picking your list!

Talk to you tonight!

Plus Teddy announces major news!</title><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2011 23:08:14 -0800</pubDate><description>Over the years of doing a radio show, a lot of people have come up and said &quot;oh, it would be so cool to do a radio show&quot; or &quot;I wish I could do what you do&quot;. So that got CabaRadio to thinking...why not give you the chance to do just that!?
That's when we came up with the idea of 'You pick the Playlist' a show where you, one of our listeners gets to come on the show and pick the music for the night. Not only that but you get to talk about why you wanted it played, or what it means to you, or hell maybe you just really dig the song!
Maybe you want to play an 80's set, or a punk set, maybe you are like us and you wanna play a whole bunch of different music all on the same show or maybe just maybe you are a musician and you wanna showcase all your own stuff, you can do that to...it's your Playlist!
Their are a few rules of course, like you have to play some Canadian Content aka CANCON and you have to play some female content aka FEMCON but other than that, the mic and music is all yours.

Join us tonight http://citr.ca/ at 11pm as the dramatic, seductive, sexy and sweet Lola Frost picks the playlist! This burlesque vixen has always had an ear for great music and it's sure to be a dazzling array of tunes!
Tune in to hear Lola Frost as she becomes CabaRadio's DJ for the night!!

The adventure awaits tonight at 11pm on CITR 101.9fm or online at http://citr.ca/

PS if you would like to Pick the Playlist some night on CabaRadio please email us at cabaradio@gmail.com with the subject &quot;I wanna pick the playlist&quot; We do it every couple of months, so sign up now and start picking your list!

Talk to you tonight!

So that got CabaRadio to thinking...why not give you the chance to do just that! That's when we came up with the idea of 'You pick the Playlist' a show where you, one of our listeners gets to come on the show and pick the music for the night. Not only that but you get to talk about why you wanted it played, or what it means to you, or hell maybe you just really dig the song!
Maybe you want to play an 80's set, or a punk set, maybe you are like us and you wanna play a whole bunch of different music all on the same show or maybe just maybe you are a musician and you wanna showcase all your own stuff, you can do that to...it's your Playlist!
Their are a few rules of course, like you have to play some Canadian Content aka CANCON and you have to play some female content aka FEMCON but other than that, the mic and music is all yours.

Join us tonight http://citr.ca/ at 11pm as CabaRadio listener, Queer FM host and Mr Gay Vancouver, Aedan Saint sits in with us and plays some dance stuff, electro-house and some older remixed stuff.
Tune in to hear Aedan Saint as he becomes CabaRadio's DJ for the night!!

The adventure awaits tonight at 11pm on CITR 101.9fm or online at http://citr.ca/

PS if you would like to Pick the Playlist some night on CabaRadio please email us at cabaradio@gmail.com with the subject &quot;I wanna pick the playlist&quot; We do it every couple of months, so sign up now and start picking your list!

So that got CabaRadio to thinking...why not give you the chance to do just that! That's when we came up with the idea of 'You pick the Playlist' a show where you, one of our listeners gets to come on the show and pick the music for the night. Not only that but you get to talk about why you wanted it played, or what it means to you, or hell maybe you just really dig the song!
Maybe you want to play an 80's set, or a punk set, maybe you are like us and you wanna play a whole bunch of different music all on the same show or maybe just maybe you are a musician and you wanna showcase all your own stuff, you can do that to...it's your Playlist!
Their are a few rules of course, like you have to play some Canadian Content aka CANCON and you have to play some female content aka FEMCON but other than that, the mic and music is all yours.

Join us tonight http://citr.ca/ at 11pm as CabaRadio listener, and YPTPL alumni Seanic Boom returns! Last time Seanic brought us covers by others, songs you thought you knew by one artist but in fact were originally done by another. Tonight, we welcome back and say farewell to Seanic Boom as he sets off to travel the world!
Join us for another exciting batch of covers by others!
Tune in to hear Seanic Boom aka Sean Mitchell as he becomes CabaRadio's DJ for the night!!

The adventure awaits tonight at 11pm on CITR 101.9fm or online at http://citr.ca/

Let's go!

PS if you would like to Pick the Playlist some night on CabaRadio please email us at cabaradio@gmail.com with the subject &quot;I wanna pick the playlist&quot; We do it every couple of months, so sign up now and start picking your list!

With your help CabaRadio was able to come 3rd place for the second year in a row!! Well actually it was best &quot;Late Night Radio Hosts&quot; and Teddy Smooth &amp; Eroc were voted number 3!
Let's put this in perspective...first place was a tie between two major radio stations and second place was Alice Cooper...all three of the shows they mentioned are on every night and are on big corporate radio stations...and then their is CabaRadio, we are on once a week and are way out at UBC with a signal that sometimes is hard to get as far away as Commercial Drive...so basically we came first and it's all thanks to your votes! So again THANK YOU!!

The backs of his knuckles brushed against the soft fleece, his fingertips gently tracing the crease between her labia. Eleanor felt her legs part of their own accord and Lars slipped his middle finger into the soft, slippery channels flesh...
'Wait,' he whispered, 'please... let me pleasure you first.'
He waited for her agreement to show in her eyes, then he dipped his head and dabbed the tip of his tongue against the hard bud of her clitoris.
Eleanor had not expected this, and her hands curled against the sheets as he began to lick and nibble at her burning flesh. Looking down, she could see his golden head moving against the dark fleece of her mons, his tongue pink and coated with the dew of her arousal, moving in and out of her.
The sight tipped her over the edge. Having taught herself to come at will with the dildo Marcus had given her, it was easy to let herself go against his warm, living tongue.
'Oh!' she cried out as her climax broke meshing her fingers in to this hair and holding his face against her convulsing flesh. 'Sweet Heaven...!'
from the book 'Educating Eleanor'

Avery!</title><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2010 23:07:16 -0700</pubDate><description>The sweet sounds and smells of Summer are finally here! I still have the smells of Portuguese sardines, from the Commercial Drive's Car Free Day in my clothes and I can't seem to get that 6 hour drum beat out of my head! It thumps and thumps as I sit and sip on my freshly muddled Mojitos. Listen.

Tonight on CabaRadio w/Teddy Smooth we are celebrating the first days of Summer with C.R. Avery!
&quot;C.R. Avery is a unique, raw and dynamic performer. His genius lies in many genres - blues, hip-hop, spoken word and rock &amp; roll. He is a one-man band, but one for this generation; with the rare ability to sing poetic verse while beatboxing simultaneously while pounding the piano and adding harmonica like a plot twist.&quot;

Join us live tonight at 11pm on CITR 101.9fm or online at http://citr.ca/

C.R. is also playing a rare, solo show this Friday at the Cultch; to get your tickets check out: http://www.thecultch.com/ and for more on C.R. Avery check out his website: http://www.cravery.com/

Also on the program tonight is another installment of &quot;Franklin T. Schneider's Theatre Review&quot; Tonight Franklin discusses the upcoming Summer Theatre Season; will it sizzle? Or fizzle? Hear Frank tell it like it is!

So that got CabaRadio to thinking...why not give you the chance to do just that! That's when we came up with the idea of 'You pick the Playlist' a show where you, one of our listeners gets to come on the show and pick the music for the night. Not only that but you get to talk about why you wanted it played, or what it means to you, or hell maybe you just really dig the song!
Maybe you want to play an 80's set, or a punk set, maybe you are like us and you wanna play a whole bunch of different music all on the same show or maybe just maybe you are a musician and you wanna showcase all your own stuff, you can do that to...it's your Playlist!
Their are a few rules of course, like you have to play some Canadian Content aka CANCON and you have to play some female content aka FEMCON but other than that, the mic and music is all yours.

Join us tonight http://citr.ca/ at 11pm as burlesque sensation and CabaRadio listener, Nicole Buckley aka Burlesque sensation, Lydia DeCarllo becomes CabaRadio's DJ for the night!!

The adventure awaits tonight at 11pm on CITR 101.9fm or online at http://citr.ca/

Let's go!

PS if you would like to Pick the Playlist some night on CabaRadio please email us at cabaradio@gmail.com with the subject &quot;I wanna pick the playlist&quot; We do it every couple of months, so sign up now and start picking your list!

So that got CabaRadio to thinking...why not give you the chance to do just that! That's when we came up with the idea of 'You pick the Playlist' a show where you, one of our listeners gets to come on the show and pick the music for the night. Not only that but you get to talk about why you wanted it played, or what it means to you, or hell maybe you just really dig the song!
Maybe you want to play an 80's set, or a punk set, maybe you are like us and you wanna play a whole bunch of different music all on the same show or maybe just maybe you are a musician and you wanna showcase all your own stuff, you can do that to...it's your Playlist!
Their are a few rules of course, like you have to play some Canadian Content aka CANCON and you have to play some female content aka FEMCON but other than that, the mic and music is all yours.

Join us tonight http://citr.ca/ at 11pm as former University of Manitoba radio host and CabaRadio listener, Kristy Hoyak, becomes CabaRadio's DJ for the night!! Kristy has promise to take us on a musical adventure unlike any other!
The adventure awaits tonight at 11pm on CITR 101.9fm or online at http://citr.ca/

Let's go!

PS if you would like to Pick the Playlist some night on CabaRadio please email us at cabaradio@gmail.com with the subject &quot;I wanna pick the playlist&quot; We do it every couple of months, so sign up now and start picking your list!

It's of cupcakes and pies and dream in the sky.
It's of want and sex and whatever happens next.
So tune in tonight to hear our lover's plight.

Also Duncan Sheilds reads love poetry!

Plus Upcoming Events and a few surprises!

With special thanks to you!</title><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2009 23:10:11 -0800</pubDate><description>The year is almost up and 2009 was a hard one for many of us. The media blitzed us with poor economic news and gave us details about some pig that could fly. But out at UBC something amazing took place! Two guys came together to create one of the worlds finest variety shows. A radio show like no other was born and out of the ashes of the past came CabaRadio with Teddy Smooth!

At CabaRadio we have had an amazing year! We started the show in April at http://citr.ca/ out at UBC and it's been a whirlwind of fun since day one!
Some notable moments include; DJ K-Tel playing as maestro of music on Episode one, CANCON BOOBS! Burgandy Brixx and the Purrfessor of Kitty Nights and then again playing live as part of the cast of 'The Wall'! Franklin T. Scheider's Theatre Review! Radio Play Madness! We had sexual lube tasting with Suzy Shamless! The Halloween Spooktacular! Talents Time with Paul Anthony! Our Photography Special! And of course, The First Annual Holiday Explosion Show!! Ho Ho Ho!

Let's not forget about, live music and interviews with bands like; Big John Bates and the Voodoo Dollz, Wintermitts, Natalie Edward, Blackberry Wood, the Marmaladies! And music by you with 'You Pick the Playlist'

Thank you so much for tuning in this year, it's been an amazing and fun filled adventure that I'm glad you are a part of! Tuesday nights at 11pm on http://citr.ca/ 101.9fm is a night we share and I hope you will continue to listen in 2010 as we delve into new and exciting shows!

So it should come as no surprise that Vancouver will be one the first places to not only celebrate being gay but have a Hall of Fame as well.
On Saturday September 19th, 2009, the Westin Bayshore Hotel in downtown Vancouver will be the place to be and be seen. The CIBC Pride Network and Qmunity have teamed up to present the first annual Q-Ball, a formal, red carpet, black tie gala fundraiser for Qmunity.
The Q Hall of Fame will recognize those that have made significant contributions to the struggle for human rights and full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered Canadians.

And tonight on CabaRadio will be talking to one of the organizers of the Q Ball who will be studio to talk about why this event is so important and why it not only involves the queer community but the hetero one as well.

As always upcoming event, groovy tunes and a few surprises!

Their seems to be so many flavours and some of the flavours are just plain strange...like the other day I was reading about bacon flavoured lube..wtf! The bacon lube got me thinking about all the different kinds of lube and why people would use them. Like the classic Pina Colada, do people actually use it? Or is it just a party gag that you give to a friend? What about strawberry, or strawberry cheesecake? It smells like a strawberry shortcake doll, wouldn't just a regular man/woman taste better than that?

Well tonight on CabaRadio we're going to expose which flavours are the best, which aren't and which ones you just want to say...WHAT THE FUCK?! Suzy Shamless will be joining us live in studio will a shwack of lube and a whole load of determination, as she breaks down the flavours one by one!
