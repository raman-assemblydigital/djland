I bring you tonight's show.  Joining me live in the studio was Jett Pace, aka Old Man Canyon, who wraps up a tour tomorrow at the Biltmore.  I also featured a few upcoming events:  Black Hen Travelling Roadshow Revue, the 9th annual Grand Cariboo Opry, and the 2nd annual East Van Opry.  Wherever you are, please support your local music scene! 

Thanks, as always, for listening, and remember to wash your hands often during this cold/flu season!

It's been a tumultuous week here in Vancouver, so I hope this podcast will be a bit of an (ahem) oasis for all y'all.  And don't forget it's Accordion Awareness Month! 

Joining me live in the studio this week was Grimsby, Ontario based singer Paul Federici.  He's been driving across Canada the past few weeks and had a few tales to tell.  Catch him in Vancouver this weekend.

Happy Father's Day and have a good time at all the Car-Free festivals taking place around Vancouver.  Thanks again to all of you folks for supporting this show.  Feel free to drop me a line to say howdy - I love hearing from you all.

Tonight's vinyl feature was a 1985 release from The Blasters, in honour of the Alvin brothers upcoming Jazz Festival appearance.  In the 2nd hour I also featured a set of Leonard Cohen songs: (yet another) Cohen tribute is coming up at the Rogue Folk Club May 9.

Near the top of the show we also chatted with Greg Rekus, who is currently touring Western Canada (in a winterized van) behind his sophomore CD &quot;Punkcoustic&quot;. 
Tonight's a full &quot;wolf&quot; moon, so you'll no doubt hear a musical reference or two to that..

Earlier in the show I pulled out some lovely 80's vinyl by South African bands in honour of the late Nelson Mandela.  I hope he's smiling down on us.
Congrats to Vancouver Community College music grad Jennifer Gasoi for her Grammy nom!  We ended the show with a cut from her nominated album (children's music category).

Get to their Vogue Theatre show Dec. 14 for future &quot;I saw 'em when..&quot; bragging rights.
Also played some vintage Dave Van Ronk to warm you folks up for the next Coen Bros. movie, which is loosely based on his life and music.

Tonight's interviews included one with Jon Landry, of Halifax band The Stanfields.  They have *two* shows coming up in Vancouver - one rock, one acoustic.
Later in the show I chatted with Victoria's Quinn Bachand, best known for his Celtic band with sister Qristina.  He now heads a new gypsy jazz band called Brishen.  Did I mention he's only 17?? Best of luck on his upcoming Berklee audition.
A famous Berklee grad provided us with some good protest music at show's end, and then...a &quot;Nightcap&quot;.  Best wishes to all my American friends on this Thanksgiving weekend. Take care and easy on the turkey!

And R.I.P. Lou Reed.  Tonight's last song is his version of &quot;See That My Grave Is Kept Clean&quot;.

He was kind enough to phone in live from several time zones away, so forgive him if he sounds a bit weary. Do see him Aug. 19 at the Railway Club here in Vancouver.  
Tonight's live session was with local actor/musician/activist Scott Perrie. He celebrates his new ep with a show Aug. 16 at the Backstage Lounge.
Some welcome rain has arrived here in Metro Vancouver - time to hunker down inside and check out some live music! Thanks as always for listening, and hope you'll tune in next week.

Nice guy!
To end the show: as it's second of three nights of Vancouver's annual fireworks competition, I did my annual spin of &quot;Indoor Fireworks&quot;.  
May your long weekend be safe, and hope there's some live music in there somewhere..

We also chatted to Jeremy Allingham of Factories and Alleyways, who have a CD release party on July 20 at the Biltmore Cabaret.
And, as we have done for many weeks, we featured more festivals; Artswells (Wells, BC) and the South Country Fair (Fort Macleod, AB).  So many festivals, so little time! :-)
Congrats to Erin, who won 2 day passes to the Vancouver Folk Music Festival.  If you're at VFMF, please stop by the CiTR tent and say hi.

Accompanying him was Vancouver guitarist Craig McCaul.  See mattmasters.com for upcoming Vancouver &amp; Vancouver Island dates.
Besides musical tributes to important figures of the Canadian folk scene who passed recently,(sound engineer Si Garber and writer Greg Quill) we tipped our hat to Bob Dylan.  He's still alive and kickin', turning 72 on May 24.

Ive dug deep through my collection to find the funniest and goofiest and/or darkest and maddest representations of the genre. It was quite a selection process, since we all know most songs are love songs in some way or another.  To further narrow the field, I have selected only songs that actually have love in the title - just so you know for sure what you are listening to. I will be broadening the genre base considerably for this special show - there will be blues, R&amp;B, jazz, country, reggae, rockabilly and more in addition to folk.  The emphasis will always be on danceability , so I expect yall to roll up the living room rug and dance your butts off when you listen to this show!</description><itunes:subtitle>Guest Host Paul Norton plays &quot;different&quot; Love Songs in honour of Valentine's Day.</itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20130213-200114-to-20130213-220200.mp3" length="115427396" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20130213-200114-to-20130213-220200.mp3</guid></item><item><title>Broadcast on 06-Feb-2013</title><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2013 20:03:44 -0800</pubDate><description>Besides new Canadian releases, tonight's show included polka from Bela Fleck, a Mardi Gras mambo, and some vintage Joni Mitchell on vinyl.

Tonight's interviews went longer than expected, but they were both so interesting, it was hard to &quot;rein 'em in&quot;.  Hope you find them interesting as well.  Barney Bentall (yes, that one :) ) called to chat about his upcoming Grand Cariboo Opry event (lotsa fun + for very worthy cause).  Following that was a lovely talk with Edmonton's Maria Dunn about her new CD and participation in The Christmas Carol Project. 

On a more serious note, tonight's show ended with a song by Australian folk icon Judy Small, which commemorates the Montreal Massacre of 1989.  Please take a moment on December 6 to remember those who have been victims of violence.

Roger McGuinn, founding member of the Byrds (who continues to have a solo career) turned 70 last Friday.  Woody Guthrie, as we all probably know by now, had a well-publicized centenary on Saturday.  We paid musical tribute to both gentlemen this warm summer evening.
Hope you're all keeping cool and dry!  As always, thanks for listening.

Two live phone interviews tonight -- first was with Royal Wood, second with evalyn parry.  Both are Toronto artists familiar to Vancouver audiences, and performing for their first time at VFMF.
Have a great time this weekend, everyone. If you're going to the festival, don't forget your hat, water bottle, sunscreen, and Birkenstocks!

Joining me live in the studio this FRIGID* winter evening was Lee Watson of Vancouver roots/bluegrass group The Breakmen.  We chatted about their new CD and upcoming tour.
Later in the show we also had a quick phone chat -- from Australia(!) -- with Ash Grunwald, who's touring here in Feb.
Take care and keep warm, everyone!

Tonight's show includes a musical commemoration of the Montreal Massacre and the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women.
