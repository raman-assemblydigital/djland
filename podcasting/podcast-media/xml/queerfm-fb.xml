Yep...two years of up to three (or more) broadcasts per week...and it's OVER.  Join us as we say goodbye to Aedan...and have some fun in the process!  QueerFM's NEW Producer/Host Jared Knudsen and QueerFM's Outgoing Producer/Host Aedan Saint - tagteam for the good, the bad, and the WTF!?!

Ryan Clayton will return next week from Victoria with Canadian Shorts, but Aedan &amp; Jared pick up the political slack and talk Canadian politics and crazy.  Aedan Saint retorts, as uaual, with even MORE American WTF Politics &amp; News...and that's just ONE HOUR of the show! Great music and LGBTQ news and weirdness from around the world - and we're here at QueerFM to make sense of it all!

Music from Jared's dytopian yet cool playlist rounds off QueerFM's roundup of the cool, not so cool and downright WTF?!? events of the past week as well as add their own spin on the crazy! 

It's another QueerFM cocktail...straight up, no ice...
