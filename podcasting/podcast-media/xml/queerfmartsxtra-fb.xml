The Mayan Calendar says...it's Armageddon.  Yeah...what do they know?  QueerFM Arts Xtra is here with Aedan &amp; Samantha...to take your mind off it.  ;)

Barb Snelgrove is down in sunny Mexico, so we put together a few geeky Van Bag events choices from Aedan Saint, Aedan &amp; Sam talk about her Vegas adventure, Aedan talks Facebook no-nos, and there's much more!

Add generous portions of beats, offbeats, and sh^t from left field, top it off with a healthy dose of new music, and a lot of WTF?!? ....and you've got yourself another QueerFM Arts Cocktail.  ;)
