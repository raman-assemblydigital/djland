I'll start the hour with 5 tracks from Kingston's Sleuth Bears. One of the members was kind of enough to let me stay at her house. I promised her that I'd play them on my show. Go Sleuth Bears!

Just had some serious job interviews, including an interview that lasted over an hour! Imagine answering questions in front of two potential co-workers for over an hour. It's tougher than it sounds. I experienced a couple of sleepless nights. Yesterday, I spent the day in the good ole US of A. I think I &quot;over-did-it&quot; on the fast food. My bones are aching. I think I'll be in tip top shape for Friday. Anyways, here's a list of bands featured in today's program: Japandroids, Shadows on stars, definitive pulse, cranberries, meg myers, death from above 1979, sleigh bells, shotgun radio, mimi page, purity ring, catcall, health, local natives, bronx cheerleaders, and yeasayer. Originally, I had Kreayshawn on my list. I changed my mind at the last second. Nothing wrong with Kreayshawn. Kreayshawn was interviewed by Nardwuar &quot;The human serviette&quot; a while ago...and Nardwuar is relentlessly awesome. Maybe next week?</description><itunes:subtitle>Busy summers!
