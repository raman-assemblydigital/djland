Goldman Sachs and CBRE (the world's larger commercial development firm) provide perspectives from the elites who trumpet gentrification, redevelopment, and the displacement of working class housing and jobs. These processes of urban class transformation are made possible and underwritten, in part, by celebration capitalism-style mega-events like the Olympic Games.</description><itunes:subtitle>London Plays Games (Part II): The Remaking of East London</itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20120807-165923-to-20120807-180051.mp3" length="58596551" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20120807-165923-to-20120807-180051.mp3</guid></item><item><title>100 Days Later: Musqueam and the Fight to Protect Cultural History</title><pubDate>Tue, 14 Aug 2012 17:00:53 -0700</pubDate><description>100 Days Later: Musqueam and the Fight to Protect Cultural History

The urban Occupy movement began in September 2011, and it continues to evolve. On the program, urban geographer Elvin Wyly talks about the Occupy movement as collectively claiming a right to the city -- a right to live in just cities that are socially and economically equitable. We then speak with an organizer from Occupy the Midwest, which is a Detroit conference drawing people from midwest cities and beyond. We discuss the socio-economic contexts of Chicago and Detroit, and the regional conference as part of the evolution of the movement in a part of the country devastated by neoliberal capitalism.</description><itunes:subtitle>Chicago, Detroit, and the Evolution of the Occupy Movement</itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20120821-165952-to-20120821-180025.mp3" length="57845951" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20120821-165952-to-20120821-180025.mp3</guid></item><item><title>A Cultural Capital?

How does this impact families in Vancouver and throughout BC cities? The City talks with Sharon Gregson of the Coalition of Child Care Advocates of BC and a former Vancouver School Board trustee about their comprehensive plan for an integrated system of early care and learning in BC - a publicly-funded, universal system. If adopted by the provincial government, the plan would provide $10/day full-time childcare to families and would be free for households with annual incomes less than $40,000.

Previously, the existing tenants (in the remaining townhouse who refused to be displaced) were served eviction notices, despite the fact that site redevelopment had not even reached the rezoning stage (and construction completion still years away).

On the podcast, we evaluate the recent social housing victory at Vancouver's Little Mountain site and reflect on the history of the struggle. We first hear from David Vaisbond, a documentary filmmaker, who has thoroughly and intimately documented the history of the Little Mountain housing struggle. We ask him to reflect on some of the most profound moments of documenting this struggle. Secondly, former MLA David Chudnovsky reflects on this victory and puts it in historical context.</description><itunes:subtitle>The City evaluates the recent social housing victory at Vancouver's Little Mountain and reflects on the history of the struggle</itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20121030-170427-to-20121030-180004.mp3" length="53160956" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20121030-170427-to-20121030-180004.mp3</guid></item><item><title>Labour Struggles in the City: UBC's CUPE 2278 On Strike</title><pubDate>Tue, 06 Nov 2012 16:58:55 -0800</pubDate><description>We examine a current labour struggle in the city.

Many were unsatisfied with the cold, modernist landscape of cities, and some just wanted an adventure. Their stories are documented in a new book, Gumboot Girls. On the podcast, we hear some of their tales and explore the reasons why these women migrated and their experiences in the small, rural - and booming  resource community of Prince Rupert. We conclude by discussing whether this vision for an alternative (non-urban) lifestyle is possible or desirable for young people today.</description><itunes:subtitle>In the 1970s, 34 young women left cities across Canada to find a different lifestyle in rural Prince Rupert, BC</itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20121127-170539-to-20121127-180031.mp3" length="52442048" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20121127-170539-to-20121127-180031.mp3</guid></item><item><title>The Working City: Urban Economies, Industrial Displacement, and the Global City</title><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2012 17:01:23 -0800</pubDate><description>In the first podcast of an ongoing series exploring urban economies, The City talks with urban geographer Winifred Curran about industrial displacement in New York City, the future of economic development in North American cities, and the assumed inevitability of deindustrialization and the post-industrial urban economy.

But, in the process, two long-standing community gardens are threatened with demolition. In this documentary, Green for All or Green for Some, Peter Driftmier explores the debate around the removal of the viaducts through the twin lenses of gentrification and environmental sustainability.

As of April 2013, city staff have yet to come back to council with final recommendations on the removal of the viaducts. In recent months, the Strathcona Residents Association has expressed serious concerns about the possibility of increased traffic volume on Prior Street, and community groups in the Downtown Eastside have also expressed similar concerns regarding increased traffic along Hastings Street.

This documentary was originally produced for Redeye on Vancouvers Coop Radio 100.5 FM and aired in Fall 2012. Peter Driftmier is a producer with the Redeye Collective, and we are pleased to bring you this documentary.</description><itunes:subtitle>Peter Driftmier brings us a documentary exploring the proposal to remove Vancouver's highway viaducts, and issues of gentrification and sustainability as two well-established community gardens are threatened</itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20130416-170334-to-20130416-180008.mp3" length="54069599" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20130416-170334-to-20130416-180008.mp3</guid></item><item><title>[Podcast] Vancouver: The Best Place on Earth?

&quot;The first half of the 21st century is anticipated to be a period of continuing large-scale urbanization in the developing world, with much of this occurring in Asian countries, especially China and India. This fundamental, on-going change in Asia presents, on the one hand, prospects for economic prosperity, new visions of an urban future and the potential for local democratization, and on the other, challenges of increasing economic and social inequities, increased resource consumption and environmental degradation.

His 2013 book details the deteriorating conditions of employment in local-serving industries immunized against international competition. The book builds on a long-term engagement with regional economic development, and challenges the assumption that low pay and poor working conditions are intrinsic characteristics of service-sector jobs.

Does the embrace of creativity really hold the promise of an alternative path, or does it threaten more of the same? Exploring these questions, Jamie Peck will chart the rise of the neoliberal city, calling attention to its mutations, its limits, and to its alternatives.

Many of these people rely on welfare and basic pension and desperately need new self contained social housing.

This years Carnegie Community Action Project (CCAP) hotel and housing report found that SROs in the DTES are more expensive than ever and that fewer still are available to low-income individuals looking for rooms.
