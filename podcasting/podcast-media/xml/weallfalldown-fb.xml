Welcome to this anniversary episode #100! One hundred episodes of punk rock radioshow Rocket From Russia! Pretty cool, I guess!

I had a pretty exciting episode to match big 100! I interviewed Joey Cape of Lagwagon / One Week Records and Chris Cresswell of The Flatliners this week. We talked about new Joey's label One Week Records, Chris's album for One Week Records, demos, producing albums with Nerf Herder and The Ataris, whistling competitions in Canada, new Lagwagon's album &quot;Hang&quot; and future plans for One Week Records.

This conversation started as an interview, but then we just ended up talking for an hour until the guys had to go on stage. I super enjoyed that conversation and unfortunately I had to leave some parts off. But I decided edit this whole conversation in one file and this file is available below.

I started this episode with some new and catchy punk rock tunes by Wringer (Bloomington, IN, USA), Dead Bars (Seattle, WA, USA), Montreal (Hamburg, Germany), Boardroom Heroes (Bethesda, MD, USA) and PUP (Toronto, ON, Canada).

Then I did two ticket giveaways, one for Uke Hunt show at The Railway Club and the other one for Slim Cessnas Auto Club show at the Wise Hall.

Right after that I did a quick interview with Steve Adamyk of Steve Adamyk Band. It had to be quick because Steve just landed in YVR Airport a few minutes before the interview and his phone had only 2% charge. We talked about their new album Dial Tone, change in sound, working with Matthew Melton, Japanese Tour and of course Egg Rolls.

Steve Adamyk Band are playing a super show on October 3rd at the Astoria with Needles//Pins, The Mandates and Fashionism.

Then after one antisuccessful attempt I managed to interview Jesse LeBourdais. We talked about his amazing new album Long Winter, upcoming Quebec/Ontario tour and hear his brand new song called Things Will Get Better.

Ok! I used the word ah-MAH-zing&quot; the way Penny Hartz from Happy Endings uses itnow I have to come with another adjective which will describe bands involved in the next block. How about &quot;fantastic&quot;? Coolcoolcoolcool!

Next block involves fantastic bands such as Chewing on Tinfoil (Ireland), The Shell Corporation, Iron Chic and Red City Radio (all from USA).

I think this episode and interview turned out to be one best this year. I got a chance to talk to Mike Park who is the founder and the owner of Asian Man Records, solo artist, as well as a member of such bands as Skankin' Pickle, The Chinkees, The Bruce Lee Band and Shaken 69.
We talked about his new album for kids called &quot;Smile&quot;, touring with Yo Gabba Gabba!, hanging out with Biz Markie and wrestler Lita, famous fans of Skankin' Pickle like Margaret Cho and Carlos Alazraqui, working with Jeff Rosenstock on the new Bruce Lee Band album and obviously his amazing record label Asian Man Records. 
And in the end of the show I gave away tickets to Polar Bear Club show at The Biltmore Cabaret this Saturday.

That was a very busy and equally exciting show. A phone interview + a guest - pretty fantastic in my opinion.

I started off things with an interview with John Wright who is a member of legendary NoMeansNo, Hanson Brothers, The Showbusiness Giants and The Infamous Scientists. John in collaboration with Le Trou du Diable microbrewery released a new beer called Punk Rauch&quot; and he will be presenting this beer to Vancouver beer and punk rock fans on November 19th at the BierCraft Restaurant on Commercial Drive. In the interview John told a little bit of history of this interesting beer project.

In the second part of the show I was joined in studio by Corey Poluck who is a member of The Ballantynes, The Valuables, a reggae record spinning DJ, picture taker at theFUTURISTS, 25% of La-Ti-Da Records and obviously one of the organizers of FALL DOWN/GET DOWN festival. We talked a lot about upcoming festival and the record label. Make sure to check out La-Ti-Da Records, in my opinion it the most exciting label right now in Canada. And if youre in Vancouver this weekend it would be illegal to miss out on a few show&amp;#1099; of FALL DOWN/GET DOWN Festival.

We also gave away two pairs of wristbands to the festival to our wonderful listeners. So good things happen to you when you do good things, for example one of those things could be listening to Rocket From Russia live on air every Thursday 10-11 am PST.

This week I decided to do a heavier show. In the first block I played punk bands which are influenced by metal (A Wilhelm Scream, Crusades, The Pagan Dead, Trigger Effect) and a metal band which has some punk influences (Kvelertak). 

In the second block I played two new songs by Kreator and Overkill. Both bands are coming in Vancouver this weekend on a co-headlining tour.

And in the end of the show, a few songs by heavy local bands - Ninjaspy, Titans Eve and Baptists.

In this episode an interview with my new friends The Smith Street Band from Melbourne, Australia. I talked to Wil Wagner, who is a singer and a guitarist in the band.

We discussed a few different topics including their new EP Dont Fuck With Our Dreams&quot; which came out on Asian Man Records this year, Tazmania, the best Australian band of all time (thats obviously Frenzal Rhomb), Australian vegetarian restaurant Lentil as Anything, drinking beer from a shoe (apparently thats common for Aussies), playing music on the tram and buying tickets to their own show. Turned out to be a pretty fun conversation! 

And in the end of the show, worldwide radio premiere of a song by a local band Porn For The Blind. They are playing at LanaLous tomorrow.

P.S. Thanks to Chris Bosma of Jack Knife Records for setting up this interview and Andrew Johnson for an amazing jpg file!

P.S.S. The whole show I was announcing an unspecial two-hour episode. Originally station asked me to do a two hour show, but then turned out that they had someone else for that second hour. Sorry for the confusion.

This episode was a bit unusual because the station participated in The Great British Columbia ShakeOut and it fell on my show.To be quit honest, I didnt know much about this happening, but I did some research, played some earthquake related songs and it worked out very well.

This week we were audited by SOCAN (Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada). Their job is to make sure that we are following Canadian content rules and that at least 35% of our airplay is partly written, produced, presented, or otherwise contributed to by persons from Canada. Very official! For us its never a problem, be we support a lot of Canadian and local artists.

Their other function is to pay radioplay royalties to the bands. So anytime we have this audit, I try to play as many as possible bands from Vancouver.

Hope you will enjoy this 100% Vancouver episode of Rocket From Russia!

Not bad, eh?

We discussed his new album Two which is probably one of the best records released this year and also talked about his involvement in different projects, working with Matt Allison and Mike Kennerty, having Jake Burns of The Stiff Little Fingers and Eric Spicer of Naked Raygun to play on his song and a connection between Dan Vapid and Vancouver local punk scene.

It's been too long since I've done a show with new music. Summer is a busy touring time and many awesome bands are going through town, so I can't miss an opportunity to talk to those amazing artists.

Pretty good episode in my opinion! Two interviews in it! Double success!

My first interview was with Chris and Scott of my favorite Canadian punk band The Flatliners. Those handsome Ontarioanians released two amazing songs on a split 7 with Make Do and Mend and their brand new album Dead Language&quot; comes out on Fat Wreck Chords on September 17th. Those were the two main topics of our conversation. In this episode you can hear three new tracks by The Flatliners and all three songs are killing it big time! 

My second interview was with Jan of The Shell Corporation. This band has been one of the most exciting discoveries of my past year. Very catchy, sing-alongy punk rock with very well written songs. We discussed their last EP Time and Pressure, W.B. Yaets poems and the genius behind Propagandhis How to Clean Everything + world radio premier of a new cover version of  Bombs Away (originally by The Police) of The Shells Corporations new album Mandrake. Exciting!

And in the end of the show I played songs by two awesome local bands Contra Code and Living With Lions, because both bands are playing shows this weekend.

Its been one year since Tony Sly of No Use For A Name passed away. No Use always will be one of the most important bands in my life, because they were the first proper punk rock band from North America which I saw back in 2003 at La Gabbia Music Club, Bassano de Grappa, Italy. 

About a month ago, the band called Scorpios came through Vancouver. This is a band which originally featured Tony Sly, Joey Cape, Jon Snodgrass and Brian Wahlstrom. They were on a tour called Tribute to Tony Sly&quot; and I got a chance to talk to Jon Snodgrass (Drag The River, Armchair Martian, Scorpios). We talked about this tour, how Jon met Tony and upcoming tribute to Tony Sly. Our conversation had some emotional moments and Im very thankful to Jon that he allowed me ask those questions.

Unexpectedly this episode happened to be a two hour show. Success!

In the first part of the show I played my interview with Jamin and Ian of an amazing band Larry And His Flask from Bend, Oregon, USA. We talked about their new album &quot;By The Lamplight, soul covers, Hobos Lament album art and gambling game cee-lo. 

Then I gave away tickets to Dead Ghosts Record Release show and played songs by the bands which played at Direct Hit! and Black Flag shows. And in the final part of the show I just played some of my favorite songs. Hope youll enjoy that!

It was Nardwuars birthday this week and I decided to celebrate it with a special show. Nardwuar the Human Serviette is the legend of music journalism! I really respect his love and passion for music. Through his amazing interviews, Nardwuar loves to introduce listeners to the music which they would have never heard otherwise.

For this episode, I decided to take those introductions to the next level and illustrate them with songs. I played the clip of the interview where Nardwuar asks interviewee about a band and then played a song by this band. Confusing? It will make more sense when you listen to the episode. Hope youll enjoy it and discover new awesome music! Doot doola doot doo!

What a wonderful band! What a wonderful people!! What a wonderful interview!!! This episode is based on my brand new interview with Annie and Katie of a cool band called Old Man Markley from Los Angeles, USA. They played a brilliant show at the Biltmore Cabaret in Vancouver this week.

If you havent heard Old Man Markley before, they are a seven-piece band which is playing a really cool mix of punk rock and bluegrass. They are signed to Fat Wreck Chords and they are cool! In the interview we discussed their new album Down Side Up&quot;, how Fat Mike helped them to produce the record, bluegrass covers of rap songs, playing shows in elementary schools, favorite recipes and of course, pijeans!

This has happened! The Steve Adamyk Band arrived to Vancouver and ripped the city apart! They just killed it in Astoria last Saturday!!! 

Before the show I got a chance to sit down with Steve and Davey on the parking lot, and despite all unsuccessful attempts of secret policia spies to arrest us, we conducted a pretty well spoken and laughed interview. We discussed brand new album Third, all cool projects the boys are involved in, Ottawa super scene and we concluded that The Cranberries are worse than Ugly Kid Joe.

This week I got a chance to talk to Stu McKillop who is a former member of Daggrmouth, member of  Precursor, In Bear Country and Aspirations, co-owner of Gold Stock Records and the boss at Rain City Recorders. Stu is one of the most important people on Canadian punk / hardcore / metal scene, not only because he is a very talented musician, but also because he records and produces a ton of bands in North America. Check out his discography page and be amazed!

This weekend, in Vancouver at the Media Club, Gold Stock Fest featuring a million of great Canadian punk and hardcore bands. Should be a great weekend!

Originally, the plan for this episode was to play my interview with Erik Petersen of Mischief Brew, but unfortunately the band was denied at the border and had to cancel their show along with our interview. I found that out last night and I was pretty limited in time to prepare for this episode, because it usually takes me at least 4-5 hours to prepare for a new episode. 

I was thinking what should I prepare for this episode and decided to do a show with an international feel. And then I asked myself, what international punk rock scene do I know the best? And obviously, its Russian punk scene. Being brought up in Russia, going to shows, buying tapes, playing shows, I know quite a bit about Russian punk scene. First it sounded like a simple idea, but it ended up being quite a challenge, because I just couldn't fit all the bands which I felt important to play in this episode. So just to set the stage, I missed a lot of important Russian/Soviet punk bands, but its impossible to cover the whole scene in one hour episode. 

The main goal of this episode is to show diversity of the Soviet/Russian punk scene, different time periods and play some of my favorite songs.

Not sure if that was interesting for the listeners of the show. I hope it was! Let me know if you liked any of those bands. It's not that easy for non-russian speaking fans to find music by some of those bands. Feel free to email me at rocketfromrussiacitr@gmail.com and I will be happy to tell you more about those bands and send you some music.</description><itunes:subtitle></itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20130502-101414-to-20130502-111152.mp3" length="55090832" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20130502-101414-to-20130502-111152.mp3</guid></item><item><title>Episode #29</title><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2013 10:17:44 -0700</pubDate><description>Happy Hello Hello Hello my friends!

Alright, the first block includes new and fresh songs by pretty well known punk bands - Transplants, U.K. Subs, Bad Religion, Left Alone, Swingin Utters, Plow United, Anti-Flag. By the way, Poorly Formed by Swingin Utters is still my favorite album which came out in 2013.

Another ecstatic episode of Rocket From Russia includes two interviews. First one with Jimmy of Polar Bear Club. The band was on tour with Bad Religion and I got a chance to speak to Jimmy after their set. We talked about how their drummer became member of Bad Religion, stupidity and humor behind their promo photos and a movie The Next Good One. 

The second interview was with magnificent Jarrod ODell of The Ballantynes. The band has a brand new 7 out on La-Ti-Da Records and just got back from their US Tour. I found those two reasons be good enough to call up Jarrod and his two sons and discuss it on air.

This is another episode of Rocket From Russia, weekly punk rock radioshow on CiTR 101.9 fm / citr.ca in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Another one hour long mix of new, international and local punk rock music. 

I started off things with a block of new pop punk and played new awesome tracks by The Steve Adamyk Band, FIDLAR, Broadway Calls, Warm Soda and NEEDLES//PINS. Great stuff! Right after that a block of new international punk with tracks by Tarakany! (Moscow, Russia), Psychopunch (Vasteras, Sweden), Crossfire Collision (Cape Town, South Africa), Unantastbar (South Tyrol, Italy) and Adaptados (Cartago, Costa Rica). And in the end of the show I played a block of 604-ska featuring songs by Rude City Riot, Bone Daddies and The Easy Brothers who played a reunion show this weekend.

I think this episode of &quot;Rocket From Russia&quot; what the show is all about - new, international and local punk rock. Those are the three main aspects and types of punk rock music I try to build my show around.

I started off things with a block of awesome new punk rock and fresh tracks by Bad Religion, Broadway Calls, Less Than Jake, Off With Their Heads, Alkaline Trio and RVIVR. That was probably one of the best blocks in the whole history of the show.

Second block was very important to me. In that block I played songs by punk bands from Serbia and Croatia. Last Friday a football match between those two nations took place and that was the first time those two countries met on the football pitch. If you're not very familiar with relationship between those two former Yugoslavian republics on and off the pitch, check out this great article. Just to give you an idea about the kind of relationship two countries, the game started with Croatian fans booing Serbian anthem and I'm sure the same will happen in Serbia for the second game... Nationalism is stupid! And I'm sure that there are Serbs and Croats who are better than this. After watching the game I just wanted to give my positive spin on that situation and I decided to play Serbian and Croatian punk bands on the show. Great bands and great songs! Hope you'll enjoy this block!

And the very last block features four songs by four awesome local bands (NEEDLES//PINS, B-Lines, The Binz and Juvenile Hall). All those four bands can be seen live tonight at the Cobalt! Come out and enjoy a great night of local music!

This week our station is being audited by SOCAN. As a radiostation in Canada we need to meet certain retirements. One of the biggest ones is playing certain percentage of Canadian content on air. When they pick my show for the audit I always try to play as much as possible local and Canadian bands to score ace on this audit! And its awesome to celebrate local talent anyways! 

In the second half of the show I interviewed James of an awesome Edmonton band called Slates. The band is playing in Vancouver this weekend, check them out because they rule!</description><itunes:subtitle></itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20130321-100550-to-20130321-110710.mp3" length="58635749" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20130321-100550-to-20130321-110710.mp3</guid></item><item><title>Interviews with Swingin Utters and The Dreadnoughts</title><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2013 09:30:00 -0700</pubDate><description>Happiest Hello Hello Hello!

Pretty busy episode which includes 2 interviews. First one with Johnny of Swingin Utters. The band released brand new album Poorly Formed and in my opinion this is one of the best records released this year so far. It was very exciting to talk to Johnny about this brand new awesome release. New album by Swingin Utters - Poorly Formed, highly recommend!!!

In the second part of the interview we heard my conversation with Andrew Squid Vicious of an awesome local polka-punk band The Dreadnoughts. On of the best bands from Vancouver, BC. Check out their polka craziness, because they are killing it!</description><itunes:subtitle></itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20130314-093000-to-20130314-110000.mp3" length="86004710" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20130314-093000-to-20130314-110000.mp3</guid></item><item><title>Fundrive Special</title><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2013 10:12:16 -0800</pubDate><description>Happy Hello Hello Hello, my friends!

This was a FUNDRIVE special episode. What it is FUNDRIVE? It's an annual event when the station asks our listeners for support. We are non-profit radiostation and we don't bombard our listeners with commercials, so we don't have too much income coming in. This year, were aiming to raise $30,000 in pledges to support our quality programming and operations, and to purchase new broadcast boards for all three studios. 

For me it's a great chance to say THANK YOU to the listeners of the show. I contacted some of my most active listeners and wanted to give back to them through playing their request. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to contact all of my listeners, because I know that there are people who are listening and I just don't have their contact info. So the whole episode is built from requests of the listeners of the show and little bit of The Real McKenzies in the end of the show :)

Thanks to everyone who has made donations to Rocket From Russia and the station!

Needless to say, that was one of the most exciting interviews Ive ever done! Joey Cape is one of my favorite songwriters in the world and Lagwagon is one my favorite bands. In this interview we discussed bands new boxset Putting Music In Its Place, Joeys other projects (Bad Loud, The Playing Favorites, Bad Astronaut) and current state of Lagwagon. Truly a fantastic experience of talking to someone whos music I loved for many many years! Too exciting!

This episode was built around my recent interview with Tom May of The Menzingers. I decided to take a little bit usual angle for our conversation. I know that Toms favorite band is The Clash and I pitched him an idea of doing an interview about this legendary band and his relationship with their music. Tom gladly accepted my offer :)

In the first part we discussed how Tom discovered The Clash and became a fan of the band. And in the second part of the show, he talked about every studio album and picked a song for me to play on air. 

P.S. I would like to thank CiTR Music Library and my friends Dylan and Dave for donating their records for this interview. Thank you friends!

Absolutely unexpectedly, that happened to be a two-hour episode. Jason, who is the host of Relentlessly Awesome, show after me, couldnt make it to the station and I had an extra hour.

On Fire!, On Call Heroes, High Hopes, Bridges Out, Take Heart). And like I didnt plan, for this extra hour I asked listeners for some requests and played those requests on air. It was fun!

Welcome to the episode #11 of weekly punk rock radioshow Rocket From Russia on CiTR 101.9 fm in Vancouver, BC, Canada!

In the very first block I decided to focus on a great Canadian punk rock label called Whens Lunch Records from Edmonton, AB. I have a lot respect for the guys who run small record labels because they love what they do and they are passionate about music. Andy who runs Whens Lunch is one of those guys. I decided to play a song from each song signed to his label (Old Wives, The Blame-Its, The Split Ups, Public Noise Concern, Still Automatic, Pulley).

Second block..wooooooof! Second block is awesome! I had this idea to have a block of songs and each song is a punch in the face and I think I completed the mission pretty successfully! Mega songs by Golliwog (Slovenia), Smartbomb (USA), A Wilhelm Scream (USA), Part Time Killer (Finland), Up For Nothing (USA), Purkinje (Spain), &amp;#1057;&amp;#1052;&amp;#1045;&amp;#1061; (Russia).

And, as always, third block includes songs by the band which are performing in Vancouver soon. Invasives are playing on Friday, December 14th at Lana Lous and Kleins96 at Zoo Shop.

That was a very interesting episode - two interviews with two Greek bands. Success! Not that often we get a chance to see Greek bands live, but this October punk band Despite Everything and metal band Septic Flesh performed in Vancouver. Obviously, me and my Greek friend Manos had to talk to them. Personally, for me it was very interesting to talk to independent bands from the other side of the world. 

We talked to Jack and Peio of Despite Everything and Fotis of Septic Flesh. Both bands play a little bit different type of music, have different status back home, but all three guys were extremely passionate about their music and what they do. 

I want to thank my friend Manos for helping out setting up those interviews, translating from Greek to English and being awesome friend!

The whole episode was built around my recent interview with Ryan Young, who is the main guy in awesome band called Off With Their Heads. In my opinion the interview turned out to be supergreat! Ryan told about their new studio album, challenges and successes of working with Bill Stevenson, crazy story about their split 7 with Discharge and being on more than 20 different record labels. Great stuff! Check it out!

New episode has arrived and it includes a lot of new music. In the very first block I tried to combine bands from different scenes and even different countries under the roof of one genre (at least in my head). Its for you to judge if this plan has worked and this block sounded organic, but it includes fresh songs by The Riverboat Gamblers, The Hives, Heike Has The Giggles, Toys That Kill, Bobgoblin, NEEDLES//PINS, One Man Army. Then I played a bit of reggae music. I though that I havent played reggae music on the show in a while and second block includes songs by Botanic Project (from Belarus), Roughhouse (Jamaica/Germany) and legendary Jimmy Cliff. 

And the final block includes songs by The New Rochelles, The Isotopes, Off With Their Heads. Last two bands are playing in Vancouver this Friday, November 16 and Im super excited to see OWTH for the first time in my life. And I played a song by The New Rochelles because their member Noah Rookie Rochelle WK has been a victim of hurricane Sandy and is going through some rough time. The guys from The Isotopes started a very good initiative releasing t-shirts and supporting this nice guy! Check out Evans interview with The Punk Site where he explains the whole situation - http://thepunksite.com/interviews.php?page=isotopes

Wow! That was a great show! At least I think so! So many phone calls and tweets from regular listeners! Thanks guys for your support! This makes me mega happy!

In the first block I decided to play new songs by a pretty well known bands in the punk rock world - Bad Religion, NOFX, Propagandhi, Anti-Flag, Pennywise, The Bouncing Souls. In my opinion, all those big punk bands becoming better and better songwriters over time. Of course we all love their early works, those classic albums like Suffer, Ribbed, The Terror State, About Time, How I Spent My Summer Vacation. But I really believe that their new records are very strong, but sometimes being overlooked by some fans. Second block has a bit of international feel and sound of horns and debauchery! New tracks by Larry And His Flask (Oregon, USA), The Locos (Madrid, Spain), The Poseurs (Moscow, Russia), Dead Rejects (Jersey City, USA), Leningrad (Saint Petersburg, Russia). And the final block represents new 7 called Lobotomized! released by nice folks at Manic Pogo. This a short Ramones tribute which includes covers performed by 2 Sick Monkeys, The Dehumanizers, Hanson Brothers and Invasives. And I played on air songs by two last bands.

This episode was built around great local record label LaTiDa Records. My guest Tim Horner started this label with his friend Dale Davies back in 2005 and the label is focused on limited run vinyl 45s and LPs. Tim (along with Dale, Corey and Vanessa) is also a man behind great festival Fall Down / Get Down which is happening in Vancouver November 1-4 and includes performances by Pointed Sticks (farewell performance), Death, Mean Jeans, Warm Soda, The Evaporators, NEEDLES//PINS, Tranzmitors, The Ballantynes and many more.

Here's the new episode of the weekly punk rock show, &quot;Rocket From Russia&quot;. This episode was built around my recent interview with Vinnie Fiorello. Vinnie is known in the punk rock world as the drummer and lyricist of the legendary ska-punk band, Less Than Jake. He is also involved in several other interesting projects. He owns a record label called Paper + Plastick Records, which I am a big fan of. The main focus of Paper + Plastic is art and music. That resonates with me personally and a lot punk kids around the world. The label has released music by such a great bands like Red City Radio, A Wilhelm Scream, The Ataris, Frank Turner, The Dopamines, The Flatliners, The Gamits, Carpenter and many others. 

The interview with Vinnie turned out to be one of the most interesting punk conversations I have ever had in my life. Some of the things he said were extremely insightful and helped me better understand the way a few things are done within the punk rock world. We discussed how he discovers and signs bands, some recent and upcoming releases on Paper + Plastick and how stories like recent conflict on stage at The Ataris show doesn't affect him as a label owner.

The interview turned out to be over 30 minutes and I couldn't fit the whole conversation in the one hour episode. If you're interested in checking out the whole thing, the full version of our conversation is available below.

First of all, Id like to apologize for the quality of online stream of todays show on citr.ca. Few of you tweeted that stream sucked :( To be quite honest with you, Im not sure what caused it, but its fixed now. Hopefully it wont happen again. 

Secondly, Id like to thank you listeners for all your calls, requests and tweets. It unbelievable how many people listen to the show and care enough to send me their feedback! Thank you so much! I really appreciate you feedback and your support! This is awesome!

So, second episode of Rocket From Russia. I really like the new timespot so far and it really works better for my work schedule. Ive started the show with a block of new pop punk music with songs by The Murderburgers (Scotland), Off With Their Heads (USA), The 20belows (Denmark), Shitty Neighbours (Vancouver, BC, Canada), Hard Girls (USA), Misfits (request for Liam). Second block represents fresh releases from Canadian record label STOMP Records. This block of music shows the diversity of that amazing record label - from reggae (The Beatdown, The Fundamentals) and rockabilly (The Hellbound Hepcats) to celtic punk (Flatfoot 56) and straight up punk rock (The Turbo A.C.s). And the final block represents bands playing THE FALL DOWN/GET DOWN! festival - Mean Jeans, NEEDLES//PINS, Fist City, The Ballantynes.

Tune in next week! Ill be giving away tickets to Less Than Jake &amp; Reel Big Fish show and Ill have Jarrod of The Ballantynes and East Van Soul Club on the show talking and spinning some records.

Welcome to the new blog and welcome to the new show - ROCKET FROM RUSSIA! ! ! 

That was the very first episode of the new show in the new timeslot 10-11 am. The idea of the show stays the same. The focus will be on new punk rock for around the world and obviously lots of local music + interviews with bands. Pretty awesome!

In this very first episode I tried to show the full spectrum of my show. So I started with block of new pop punk tunes featuring songs by One Man Army, Fear of Lipstick, Toys That Kill, The Throwaways, Masked Intruder and Cobra Skulls. Then the block of international punk rock from Spain (The Locos), Russia (Distemper) and UK (Argy Bargy). Next block featured songs by legendary Vancouver bands - Pointed Sticks, The Evaporators and Tranzmitors. That was the first weekly block promoting upcoming THE FALL DOWN/GET DOWN! festival presented by LATIDA records. Starting this episode, every week I will be introducing listeners of CiTR to the bands playing that awesome festival.

Stay tuned for more episodes and more punk rock music on the show. And here are few links to get in touch with me:

That was the last episode of punk rock radio show We All Fall Down. I inherited the show from my good friend Marielle. Ive been a host of We All Fall Down for almost 3 years now and I think Im ready for the change. It all started with a change of time slot and then I decided to change the name of the show. I think I came up with a name which reflects my personality and my background. So the new show is called Rocket From Russia and the new timeslot is 10-11am on Thursdays on CiTR 101.9 fm and citr.ca. But it wont affect all the podcast listeners. I will still have all the new (and old) episodes available here. 

Id like to thank my friend Marielle who gave me a chance to host my own radioshow and made my dream come true! Thanks for all support, knowledge and fun I got from you! Marielle is the best! Much love!

This episode was build around the interview with Mille Petrozza of Kreator. My friend Manos and I interviewed Mille last week, before their set at the Rickshaw. We discussed Kreators new album Phantom Antichrist, Milles favorite punk bands and his love for John Sinclair. In the end of the show Marielle called in and we said goodbye to We All Fall Down.

Well, stay tuned for the first episode of Rocket From Russia. And thank you for your support!

In the first half of this episode Ive played new songs by Agry Bargy (from UK), American Werewolves (USA), Crusades, Propagandhi (both from Canada), Never Been Famous (Austria). I forgot to mention on air that the band American Werewolves was recommended to me by the regular listener of the show - Dexter. Thanks man!

In the second part of the show, Ive played my interview with KJ Jansen from Canadian pop punk band Chixdiggit!. Weve discussed bands latest release Safeways Here We Come, the best dollar store in the world and how Norwegians are European Canadians! 

There will be an announcement next week about some changes that will occur to this show. Stay tuned!

Yeah, that was my first time on air live in a month and yes, its been way too long. Thanks for all the tweets and messages. The reason for my absence was my trip to motherland Russia. Ive spent there almost three weeks and I was so happy to visit my hometown Novosibirsk first time in 5 years. That was super fantastic time! I had a chance to spend time with my family, my Dad, my old friends and people I grew up with. I also played a show with my friends, band called PMA from Novosibirsk. You can watch our set here. And we also shot a silly video for a song we wrote together. The video can be watched below.

New episode! Loads of new music. Opening block with some Siberian punk rock. Then a block including new songs by NOFX, Propagandhi, Brixton Robbers, Dead Rejects, Morning Glory. Next, of course, a pop punk block featuring tacks by Masked Intruder, Accelerators, Occult Detective Club, Goin Places. And in the end, as usual, songs by the bands which are performing in Vancouver this weekend (Chixdiggit!, Old Wives, The Isotopes, Big John Bates).

There are some changes coming with the show including change of the timespot and even change of the name of the show. But it shouldn't affect people who are usually listen to podcasts. More details soon!

P.S. And special shout out to my friend and listener of the show Trevor. Happy birthday my friend!!!

That was a very fun episode! Two great interviews! First one was scheduled to be with Joe Keller, bassist of an awesome band called Night Birds, but during the interview the whole band joined Joe and it turned to be super fun and entertaining interview featuring all four members of Night Birds! The second interview was with Ryan from The Atom Age. We've talked about their new album, visit to Sun Record, Hollywood produced video and passion for history. 

Tomorrow I'm leaving to my motherland Russia, to my home town Novosibirsk! Super stoked to see my family and my friends! Should be a lot of dun! And I will be playing a show with my buddies PMA. Pretty stoked to perform again! So in the end of this episode I've decided to play all the bands we will be playing with. Four of those bands are from Novosibirsk (PMA, &amp;#1041;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1100;&amp;#1103; &amp;#1055;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1099;, TrueFish!, We Lost Our Aim) and two of them are from Barnaul (&amp;#1053;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1073;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1084;, Dead Drunk)! 

I pre-recorded 3 next episodes and I have something special for you. Even I'll be far far away, but the show still will be on-air!

Have a great rest of the summer and I'll see you in September!

Guest: Tim of Punk International</title><pubDate>Thu, 02 Aug 2012 13:01:00 -0700</pubDate><description>Hello Hello Hello!

Obviously we started the show with a song by No Use For a Name in memoriam of Tony Sly who passed two days ago. I was shocked when I found that out NUFAN was the first band Ive seen live and always had a special place in my heart. My deepest condolences to Tonys wife and daughters, FAT family, NUFAN band members and friends.

I had my friend Tim over as a guest. Tim was the first person Ive met in Canada and he always been an example of music fan for me. His knowledge about punk rock is endless. Weve played songs of some of our favorite album released this year. Let us know if you think weve missed anything :)

Last episode of the radioshow had 2 main topic. The first part was built around my interview with Jake Kiley, the guitarist of punk band Strung Out. The band is coming to Vancouver as a part of Twisted In A Suburban Wasteland&quot; Tour and will perform live two albums Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues and Twisted By Design back to back at the Biltmore Cabaret on July 19th.

Today I was happy to welcome back my good friend Jesse LeBourdais. That was his third appearance on the show, and I am a big fan as you can tell.

Jesse is a guitarist and singer in awesome local punk band Cambridge and he also performs as a solo artist playing folk-punk. His brand new album &quot;I Go By The Sound&quot; came out about a month ago and I've invited Jesse back to the show. We've talked about this brand new release, difference in writing punk and folk songs, challenges of touring huge Canada and as usual, Jesse had performed his song &quot;Union Man&quot; live on air. Check it out below!

This episode was built around my interview with Slim Cessna of Slim Cessna's Auto Club. The band is coming to Vancouver and will play a show on July 24th at the Biltmore Cabaret. 

We've discussed Belgian beers, 20th Anniversary shows at The Lions Lair and Slim's friendship with Jon Snodgrass. On that note I've played songs by Armchair Martian, Drag The River and Jon's solo stuff. Slim also told about interesting show he had recently played with his son's band The Sterling Sisters and I've played their song Raised You in the West. And in the end of the show few recommendations from Slim.

Recently I did two phone interviews in one show, this time I did two in-studio interviews. Its wasnt very easy to pull off logistically, but it turned out to be a pretty fun hour.

First interview was with Evan from local pop punk band called Isotopes. Isotopes is the greatest band in the world to sing about baseball. All their songs are about baseball related topics and even Im not very familiar with this type of sport, but I really love the concept and obviously their songs. Bands new Blood Diamond 7 is out and the Release Party is happening at The Media Club this Friday, May 11th with Greenback High, Keep Tidy, Joyce Collingwood.

Second interview was with local post-hardcore band called Anchoress. Anchoress just release their brand new album called Crime &amp; Compass and the CD Release Party is happening on Saturday, May 12th with The Jen Huangs, Northern Guard, Mete Pills, One Life Animal.

There were too many bands I was excited to play - The Dopamines, Lowtalker, Battle Snakes, OK Pilotactually all other bands are fantastic and I was stoked to play their amazing songs too! Yis!

I gave away a pair of tickets to go see Misfits and no one called in to get Strike Anywhere tickets. Actually, my friend Ilia whm called from Russia, answered the question correctly and technically won the tickets, but obviously he couldnt make it to the show. Also Jonny Bones and my friends from Parksville called in. So that was a phone call day! Thanks for calling and listening!

Obviously, I went to see Strike Anywhere at the Rickshaw. I interviewed Thomas Barnett, singer of SA, and Im planning to play the clip of this interview next week on air.</description><itunes:subtitle></itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20100603-125900-to-20100603-140700.mp3" length="64997918" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20100603-125900-to-20100603-140700.mp3</guid></item><item><title>We All Fall Down Broadcast on 27-May-2010</title><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2010 13:00:00 -0700</pubDate><description>This week I had Andrew and Slut from The Wrecktals.

I had it in my head yesterday; it really sucked. My night yesterday kinda sucked too. I met a really nice guy from California, though, and it made me feel a lot better. Meeting him and seeing Pelican were the best parts of my night, so I guess I didn't have such a bad time after all. On another note, I would not recommend getting pierced at PunctureHaus. I won a &quot;free&quot; piercing but ended up paying $50 for the jewelry anyways. It was probably also the worst piercing of my life. I'm usually okay with needles invading my skin and flesh; I find it relaxing and even cathartic. But I got my septum pierced there, and let's just say that there was a lot of blood, crying, and pain. It wasn't done right, and I had my real piercer take it out so that she can re-do it in the future. NO FUN.

The show wasn't as messy as I expected it to be. Or was it? Ya know, final exams are like the ass raping of my life. Avoid them like the plague. On another note, I've been told that I need to have Cuteness Reduction Surgery done, because I'm way too cute! What an ego booster! Hope you all are having a safe and happy holiday so far ^__^</description><itunes:subtitle></itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20061207-130440-to-20061207-140247.mp3" length="55554536" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20061207-130440-to-20061207-140247.mp3</guid></item><item><title>Broadcast on 30-Nov-2006</title><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2006 13:01:28 -0800</pubDate><description>There was rocking, there was rolling, and there were some pretty bad f-ups. ooooops.

There are so many little gems on TEH INTERNETS. Unfortunately, I couldn't play all of them, but I think I got the point across. Check out my playlists if you're interested in finding out which Nintendo cover bands I played (www.weallfalldowncitr.blogspot.com)-------PS: thank you to everyone that phoned in to donate, place a song request, and inform me about other extremely nerdy things that I should check out.

Each flower fades away like incense / 
Sounds and scents turn in the evening air / 
A melancholy waltz, a soft and giddy dizziness / 

Each flower fades away like incense / 
The violin thrills like a tortured heart / 
A melancholy waltz, a soft and giddy dizziness / 
The sky is sad and beautiful like some great resting-place. / 

The violin thrills like a tortured heart, / 
A tender heart, hating the wide black void. / 
The sky is sad and beautiful like some great resting-place / 
The sun drowns itself in its own clotting blood / 

A tender heart, hating the wide black void, / 
Gathers all trace from the pellucid past. / 
The sun drowns itself in clotting blood. /

Random phrases I hear at CiTR: &quot;Is there an I. P. Freeley here?&quot;; *Jules comes up to me, points a finger at my hip and makes a gun noise* then says, &quot;You just lost a liver and hip bone&quot;; &quot;Men find blazing confidence so hot. The moral of the story is that you need to get everyone at the party to line dance&quot;; &quot;We went to Planet Slayer&quot;. I gave Robin 10 mins of my show this week because he had a super long interview to play. ERGO, my show was shortened quite drastically. One day I'm going to program a show that will hip the hop. Cadence Weapon, Jurassic 5, DJ Shadow...one day, but probably never. I'm hungry.</description><itunes:subtitle></itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20061026-130329-to-20061026-134857.mp3" length="43481135" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="true">http://playlist.citr.ca/podcasting/audio/20061026-130329-to-20061026-134857.mp3</guid></item><item><title>Broadcast on 19-Oct-2006</title><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2006 13:02:51 -0700</pubDate><description>This week: an interview with Bryan from the Sword!

Yeah, neither did I. Can you imagine what that would look like? I mean, both those guys are pretty gnarly lookin dudes, but when you bring them together, they must form some sort of UGLY monstrosity.
